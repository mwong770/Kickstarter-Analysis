## <a name="limitations"></a> :no_entry_sign:  Limitations

* Analysis by country is limited since many countries have very few campaigns in the dataset.
* Analysis by categories or subcategories is limited since many categories or subcategories have very few campaigns in the dataset.
* The end date of the current data is March 2017. Campaigns after this data may impact campaigns' success rate.
* It is unclear if this sample was a random sample or how this sample was selected.
* There have been over 400,000 Kickstarter projects thus far. Our Dataset includes only 4114 campaigns (approximately 1%). It has not been determined whether this is a sufficiently large enough sample to be statistically significant.
